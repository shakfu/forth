# Test: Ties
# Tests tied notes (extended duration) and slurs
# Expected: Tied notes have combined duration

piano:
(tempo 120)

# Duration tie: half + half = whole (2.0s at 120 BPM)
c2~2

# Quarter + quarter = half
d4~4

# Multiple ties: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 whole notes
e1~1~1

# Tie across different durations: half + quarter = 3 beats
f2~4

# Slur (legato connection between different pitches)
c4~d~e~f
